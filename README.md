# Biomedical Electronics
Materials for the course on Biomedical Electronics taught in the 8th semester at the undergraduate level at the [Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Information Technologies](http://feit.ukim.edu.mk), [Ss Cyril and Methodius University of Skopje](http://ukim.edu.mk/), Macedonia.

The course focuses on human physiology, electronic measurement devices and algorithms for processing of biomedical signals.
All the algorithms are implemented using Python 3.6, using Numpy, Scipy, and Matplotlib.
The whole installation procedure to get going is documented in the lecture materials.
